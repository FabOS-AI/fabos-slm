Select the device you added in [Step 1](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/step1) as `Deployment Resource`. The service options can be changed or left at the default values. Click on the `CHECKOUT` button to deploy the service offering on the selected resource:

The deployment of the service on your device is triggered and will take some time. After the deployment was successfull you should see the service instance in the overview in the `Services` section:

If you click on the port of the service instance your deployed Node-RED instance should open:
