# Step 1: Add a resource

Log in to the Service Lifecycle Management user interface running on port 8080 of your host (e.g. http://myhost.local:8080). If not changed, default user is `fabos` with password `password`.

First, you need to add a resource which will be managed by the Service Lifecycle Management. Go to the `Resources` section and click on the `+` button in the lower right corner:

Select `ADD EXISTING HOST`, enable `SSH access to resource` and enter the credentials of your device:

::: warning ATTENTION
User must be in group `sudo`

As a result you should see your add device as resource in the overview:
