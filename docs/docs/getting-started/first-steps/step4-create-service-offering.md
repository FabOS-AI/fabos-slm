Your first step should look like this:

In the next steps you need to enter some Docker Compose related information. Download the three files <a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml" download>docker-compose.yml</a>, <a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/dot-env" download=".env">.env</a> and <a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/env.list" download>env.list</a> or create it with the following content:

<a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml" download>`docker-compose.yml`</a>

```
version: "3"

services:
  node-red:
    image: nodered/node-red:2.2.2
    env_file:
      - env.list
    ports:
      - "${NODERED_PORT}:1880"
```

<a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/dot-env" download=".env">`.env`</a>

```
NODERED_PORT=1880
```

<a href="/files/first-steps/docker-compose/env.list" download>`env.list`</a>

```
TZ=Europe/Berlin
```

Upload the files in the corresponding fields
1) `docker-compose.yml` in `Compose File`

2) `env` in `.env File (Optional)`. Enable Service Option for `NODERED_PORT`:
![Service offering wizard - step 2 .env file](/img/figures/first-steps/first-steps-step4-wizard-step2-dot-env.png)

3) `env.list` in `Environment Variable Files -> env.list`. Enable Service Option for `TZ`:
![Service offering wizard - step 2 env.list file](/img/figures/first-steps/first-steps-step4-wizard-step2-env-list.png)

Click on the `NEXT` button. All environment variables with `Service Option` enabled will be converted to a service option of the service offering. Service options are values that can be edited by the users during the order process. For this example enter the following information for the two service options:

Click on the `FINISH` button to create your service offering.
